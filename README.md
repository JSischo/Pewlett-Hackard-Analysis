# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose of the Analysis
> The purpose of this project was to utilize previously conducted queries and newly constructed databases regarding potentially retiring employees to help the executives at PH determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Conducting these anaylses will help the company plan for a large number of retirees to enable them to plan hiring and training plans.

## Results:

Following are the most pertinent findings from the queries that were conducted:
- From the unique_titles.csv database we find that there are **90,398** employees that will be retiring in the near future from HP.
- From the retiring_titles.csv file we see some results that are a little concerning. We are able to ascertain that a large number of retirees will be from senior level positions, almost 64%. The largest number at the Senior Engineer level followed very closely by Senior Staff. See below for the acual numbers.

- On the plus side, the company may only be loosing tow managers to retirement. 

## Summary:

1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
